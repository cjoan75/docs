# First login

This gives you an oversight how-to login for the first time.

## i-doit cloud

If you are using the i-doit cloud service, you can access your i-doit cloud instance at the following  companies URL

    https://<your_instance_identifier>.i-doit.cloud/

Your instance identifier is initially requested by your administrator when ordering i-doit and is assigned at the time of installation and should usually match your company's name. If you don't know your company's instance identifier contact your administrator or the [i-doit support][helpdesk].

## On-premises

If your company runs an on-premises installation of i-doit you'll have a custom URL that is assigned by your administrator.

Your username and password should have been sent to you by your administrator.

Point your Web browser to the Web GUI of i-doit to see the login screen:

!!! info "No default login"
    i-doit has no default login like an admin user called `admin` with a trivial password like `admin`. Instead, during the installation the first individual user will be created automatically. This user has the admin role with all rights and permissions.
