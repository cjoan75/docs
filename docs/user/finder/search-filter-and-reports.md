# Search filters and reports

The main search in the `Finder` allows to search fulltext for information. If you enter data in the search bar the `Finder` will perform a freetext search and show you results in a suggestion search dropdown. Once you press enter, the results are shown in the main `Finder` list.

On the right side of the search bar is a filter button that allows you to filter (search) for specific values. You can navigate through all available attributes and enter search terms related to the attribute you are looking for.

All filter and search terms are shown as filter bubbles in the search bar, so you can narrow your search down or change certain parts of your search.

Your searches can be saved for future re-use. This can be useful either if you use a specific search query very often or if you want to have a standardized report that you use to export data on a regular basis.
