# Views and presets

The `Finder` generates tables that offer different views on the documented data. The views can be sorted by the different columns and the columns can be resized to the users needs.

Which columns are shown is defined by the `View presets`. `View presets` have either a class or a global context.

A class context means that the user can e.g. have a specific `View preset` for servers, that maybe show IP addresses and hard disks and on the other hand have another `View preset` for contact persons that show names and e-mail addresses.

If a `View preset` has a global context, it can be used to list objects of all classes together. This is useful for example for showing search results.

On the left side of the `Finder` tables is a navigation element that gives you the possibility to navigate through either object classes or physical locations. These are navigation switch views, but they do not count as filters and do not show up as search bubbles in the search bar.
