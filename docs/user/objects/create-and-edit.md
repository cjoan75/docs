# Create and edit

Objects can be created in the main screen of the `Finder`. You choose an object class on the left side (e.g. `Server`) and press the `New object +` button on top of the list. A dialog opens up that gives you the possibility to set some additional options for the object creation, such as creating multiple objects at once and numbering.

Editing an object can be done in multiple ways. The easiest way is to open up a single object and press the `Edit` button on any of the categories. There is also in-line editing and multi-editing functions that are explained in the `Finder` section.
