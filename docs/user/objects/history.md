# History

Each object has a history that keeps track of all events that happen to an object. Events can be either `create`, `update`, `archive`, `delete` or `restore` operations.

Every event that affects an object is being saved in the history, complemented with a timestamp and information about the initiator of the event as well as technically more detailed information about the event.

You can access the history either in the corresponding category within an object or use the global history tool from the toolbar.
