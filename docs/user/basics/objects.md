# Objects

An object is a single entity that you document in i-doit.

## Comparison to assets/configuration items

An object corresponds to an asset in asset management or configuration item (CI) in ITIL. It can either be a piece of physical hardware, e.g. a server, a router, a laptop PC etc., or it can be a piece of logical information such as a maintenance contract or a contact person.

The entity itself can hold lots of information, stored in attributes and values. There is no limit on how many information is stored to a single entity.

What a single object represents in your IT documentation is ultimately defined by yourself â€“ but i-doit comes with a standard set that is predefined.

## Object or attribute?

Users often ask if for example a single hard drive is an object or an attribute.

In the predefined set that ships with i-doit a hard drive is an attribute. But if you decide that it is very important for you to keep track of all your hard drives in detail then you might create an own object class for hard drives.

Treating hard drives as dedicated objects gives you multiple advantages in handling them in the software. It is for example easier to track their location.
