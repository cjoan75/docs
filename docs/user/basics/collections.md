# Collections

Collections are compilations of object classes. They are defined by the administrator of the system, but i-doit ships with a predefined set of collections.

In the `Finder` drop-down menu you can select two another kinds of collections, `Favorites` and `All classes`. `Favorites` contains those classes that the user pins with a "favorite star". `All classes` always show all classes that are enabled in your i-doit instance.

Classes appear directly under the `Finder` menu in the toolbar and every user is able to individually hide classes that are not often used. They are still available to the user via the `more` button on the bottom of the class dialog.
