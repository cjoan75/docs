# Categories and attributes

Attributes are the smallest entity of the documentation. They are identifiers that help to structure the documentation. An attribute (such as `serial number`) can have one or more values. Depending on the kind of attribute there can be certain restrictions that come along with an attribute. The attribute `IP address` for example has strict formatting rules.

Categories bundle attributes in logical clusters of information that belongs together. The accounting category for example bundles all attributes that belong to the accounting topics, such as cost center or date of acquisition.

i-doit comes with hundreds of predefined categories and thousands of attributes, but you can still create your own categories and attributes if there is something missing for you.
