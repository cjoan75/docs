# CSV import

The CSV import allows you to upload and import any CSV files into i-doit. CSV stands for "comma separated value".

The import process guides you to different steps that are needed to analyze the data. At first you need specify technical details about the CSV file, then you need to define mappings between columns in the CSV to i-doit attributes. The last configuration step allows to define how already existing data sets should be treated when importing data.
